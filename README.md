Contents
1. Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms.
Patterns included:
Singleton: Ensure a class has only one instance globally.
Factory Method: Define an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses alter the type of objects created.
Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related objects.
Builder: Construct complex objects step-by-step.
Prototype: Create object clones.
2. Structural Patterns
Concerned with object composition and structure.
Patterns included:
Adapter: Convert one interface to another.
Bridge: Separate abstraction from implementation.
Composite: Treat individual and composite objects uniformly.
Decorator: Add new behavior dynamically.
Facade: Simplify complex systems by providing a unified interface.
Flyweight: Share object instances to save memory.
Proxy: Control access to objects.
3. Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects.
Patterns included:
Observer: Notify multiple objects about state changes.
Strategy: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each, and make them interchangeable.
Command: Encapsulate requests as objects.
Iterator: Provide a way to access elements sequentially without exposing the structure.
Template Method: Define the skeleton of an algorithm and let subclasses fill in details.
Chain of Responsibility: Pass requests along a chain of handlers.
State: Allow objects to change behavior based on their state.
