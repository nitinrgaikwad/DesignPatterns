# Design Patterns Guide

A comprehensive guide to common software design patterns organized by category.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and explanations of essential software design patterns. Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**
  - Ensures a class has only one instance globally
  - Provides a global point of access to that instance

- **Factory Method**
  - Defines an interface for creating objects
  - Lets subclasses alter the type of objects created
  - Promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes

- **Abstract Factory**
  - Provides an interface for creating families of related objects
  - Useful when a system should be independent of how its products are created

- **Builder**
  - Constructs complex objects step by step
  - Allows the same construction process to create different representations

- **Prototype**
  - Creates new objects by cloning an existing object (prototype)
  - Reduces the need for creating subclasses

### 2. Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Adapter**
  - Converts one interface to another
  - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together

- **Bridge**
  - Separates abstraction from implementation
  - Enables independent variation of both

- **Composite**
  - Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly
  - Creates tree structures of objects

- **Decorator**
  - Adds new behaviors to objects dynamically
  - Provides a flexible alternative to subclassing

- **Facade**
  - Simplifies complex systems by providing a unified interface
  - Reduces dependencies between subsystems

- **Flyweight**
  - Shares object instances to save memory
  - Useful when dealing with a large number of similar objects

- **Proxy**
  - Controls access to objects
  - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with communication between objects, how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

- **Observer**
  - Notifies multiple objects about state changes
  - Implements distributed event handling systems

- **Strategy**
  - Defines a family of algorithms
  - Makes algorithms interchangeable within that family

- **Command**
  - Encapsulates requests as objects
  - Parameterizes clients with different requests

- **Iterator**
  - Provides sequential access to elements
  - Hides the underlying representation

- **Template Method**
  - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm
  - Lets subclasses override specific steps

- **Chain of Responsibility**
  - Passes requests along a chain of handlers
  - Avoids coupling sender to receiver

- **State**
  - Allows objects to change behavior based on internal state
  - Makes state-specific behavior explicit
