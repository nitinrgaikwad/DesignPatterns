# Design Patterns Guide

A comprehensive guide to common software design patterns organized by category.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and explanations of essential software design patterns. Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**
  - **Problem**: Need to ensure a class has only one instance and provide global access to it
  - **Solves**: Resource sharing, managing global state, coordinating system-wide actions
  - **Example Use Case**: Database connection pools, configuration managers, logging services

- **Factory Method**
  - **Problem**: Need to create objects without specifying their exact classes
  - **Solves**: Dependency management when object creation requires complex logic
  - **Example Use Case**: Creating UI elements based on user preferences, document generators for different formats

- **Abstract Factory**
  - **Problem**: Need to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
  - **Solves**: System independence from how its products are created, composed, and represented
  - **Example Use Case**: Creating UI elements for different operating systems, cross-platform toolkit implementations

- **Builder**
  - **Problem**: Need to construct complex objects step by step
  - **Solves**: Construction of objects that require multiple steps or configurations
  - **Example Use Case**: Building complex documents, creating complex API requests

- **Prototype**
  - **Problem**: Need to create objects based on existing instances
  - **Solves**: Object creation when instantiation is costly or complex
  - **Example Use Case**: Creating copies of complex objects, managing document templates

### 2. Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Adapter**
  - **Problem**: Incompatible interfaces need to work together
  - **Solves**: Integration of systems with different interfaces
  - **Example Use Case**: Third-party library integration, legacy system compatibility

- **Bridge**
  - **Problem**: Need to separate abstraction from implementation
  - **Solves**: Platform independence, avoiding permanent binding between interfaces
  - **Example Use Case**: Cross-platform GUI toolkits, device driver implementations

- **Composite**
  - **Problem**: Need to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly
  - **Solves**: Creation of tree structures and recursive compositions
  - **Example Use Case**: File system hierarchies, graphics rendering systems

- **Decorator**
  - **Problem**: Need to add behavior to objects dynamically
  - **Solves**: Extension of object functionality without altering existing code
  - **Example Use Case**: Adding features to streams, UI component enhancement

- **Facade**
  - **Problem**: Complex system needs a simpler interface
  - **Solves**: Complexity management in large systems
  - **Example Use Case**: Library wrappers, unified API for complex subsystems

- **Flyweight**
  - **Problem**: Need to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently
  - **Solves**: Memory usage optimization
  - **Example Use Case**: Text editors, game character rendering

- **Proxy**
  - **Problem**: Need to control access to an object
  - **Solves**: Access control, lazy initialization, logging
  - **Example Use Case**: Virtual proxy for large images, access control in security systems

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with communication between objects, how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

- **Observer**
  - **Problem**: Need to notify multiple objects about changes to another object
  - **Solves**: One-to-many dependency management
  - **Example Use Case**: Event handling systems, MVC architecture implementations

- **Strategy**
  - **Problem**: Need to use different variants of an algorithm
  - **Solves**: Algorithm selection at runtime
  - **Example Use Case**: Sorting algorithms, payment processing methods

- **Command**
  - **Problem**: Need to decouple sender and receiver of a request
  - **Solves**: Command queuing, logging, and undoable operations
  - **Example Use Case**: GUI commands, transaction management

- **Iterator**
  - **Problem**: Need to access elements of a collection without exposing its structure
  - **Solves**: Uniform traversal of different collections
  - **Example Use Case**: Database record traversal, custom collection implementations

- **Template Method**
  - **Problem**: Need to define the skeleton of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps
  - **Solves**: Code reuse while maintaining algorithm structure
  - **Example Use Case**: Framework classes, data mining operations

- **Chain of Responsibility**
  - **Problem**: Need to pass requests along a chain of handlers
  - **Solves**: Decoupling of request senders and receivers
  - **Example Use Case**: Logging frameworks, event handling systems

- **State**
  - **Problem**: Object behavior needs to change based on internal state
  - **Solves**: State-dependent behavior management
  - **Example Use Case**: Vending machines, workflow management
